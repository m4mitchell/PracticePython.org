# Exercise 1 "Character Input" on Practicepython.org
# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
# Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# Extras:

# Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many 
#  copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.

name = input("What is your name?\n")
age = int(input("How old are you?\n"))
reps = int(input("Pick a number from 1-10:\n"))
yob = 2019 - age
year100 = str(yob + 100)
print(("Hi " + name + "! You will turn 100 in " + year100 + "!\n") * reps)
