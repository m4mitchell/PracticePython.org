# Exercise 3 - Practicepython.org

# Write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
for num in a:
    if num < 5:
        print(num)

# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements 
# less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

b = []
for num in a:
    if num < 5:
        b.append(num)
print(b)

# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the 
# original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

c = []
usernum = int(input("Please enter a number:\n"))
for num in a:
    if num < usernum:
        c.append(num)
print(c)
